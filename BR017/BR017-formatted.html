<br>
<div>This amount is only valid until {DateAdd({[L011]}|+5|MM/dd/yyyy|Day)}</div>
<br>
<div>Prior to beginning foreclosure, we are required under the terms of your loan to notify you of your default. As of today, your loan is in default and is due for {[M026]}. The amount past due as of the date of this letter is {Math({[C001]} + {[M585]} - {[M013]}|Money)}, which consists of the following:</div>

<div>TOTAL YOU MUST PAY TO CURE DEFAULT: {Math({[C001]} + {[M585]} - {[M013]}|Money)}</div>
<br>
<div>You can cure this default by making a payment of {Math({[C001]} + {[M585]} - {[M013]}|Money)} by {DateAdd({[L011]}|+5|MM/dd/yyyy|Day)}. Please note any additional monthly payments, late charges and other charges that may become due under the Note, Security Instrument and applicable law after the date of this notice must also be paid.</div>
<br>
<div>If you do not cure the default within the 30-day period, we intend to exercise our right to accelerate the mortgage payments. This means that whatever is owed on the original amount borrowed will be considered due immediately and you may lose the chance to pay off the original mortgage in monthly installments. If full payment of the amount of default is not made within thirty (30) days, we also intend to instruct our attorneys to start a lawsuit to foreclose your mortgaged property. If the mortgage is foreclosed your mortgaged property will be sold to pay off the mortgage debt. If we refer your case to our attorneys, but you cure the default before they begin legal proceedings against you, you will still have to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees, actually incurred. However, if legal proceedings are started against you, you will have to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees within allowable fees and costs. Any attorney’s fees will be added to whatever you owe us, which may also include our reasonable costs. If you cure the default within the thirty-day period, you will not be required to pay attorney’s fees.</div>
<br>
<div>If you have not cured the default within the thirty-day period and foreclosure proceedings have begun, you still have the right to cure the default prior to any foreclosure sale. You may do so by paying the total amount of the unpaid monthly payments plus any late or other charges then due, as well as the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs connected with the foreclosure sale and perform any other requirements under the mortgage. A notice of the date of the foreclosure sale will be sent to you before the sale. Of course, the amount needed to cure the default will increase the longer you wait.</div>
<br>
<div>Failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in this notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument foreclosure by judicial proceeding and sale of the Property. You have the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to assert in the foreclosure proceeding the non-existence of a default or any other defense you may have to acceleration and foreclosure. If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, we may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may foreclose this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding. We are also entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Mortgage, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.</div>
<br>
<div><b>You may find out at any time exactly what the required payment will be by calling us at the following number: {[plsMatrix.CSPhoneNumber]} and select option #2 or {[plsMatrix.SPOCContactEmail]} This payment must be in cash, cashier’s check, certified check or money order and made payable to us at {[plsMatrix.PayoffAddr1]}, {[plsMatrix.PayoffAddr2]}.</b></div>
<br>
<div>You should realize that a foreclosure sale will end your ownership of the mortgaged property and your right to remain in it.</div>
<br>
<div>Please consider the following:</div>
<br>
<div>You should contact a HUD Counselor at HUD’s National Servicing Center at (877) 622-8525/TDD (800) 877-8339 or the Homeownership Preservation Foundation (888-995-HOPE) to speak with counselors who can provide assistance and may be able to help you avoid foreclosure.</div>
