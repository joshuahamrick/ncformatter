<div>Dear Valued Customer(s),</div>
<br>
<div>Based on a careful review of your mortgage account, we’re offering you an opportunity to enter into a Trial Period Plan for a mortgage modification. This is the first step toward qualifying for a modification to bring your mortgage current and allow you to make a principal and interest payment that is equivalent or almost equivalent to your existing contractual principal and interest payment. If you satisfy all of the terms of the offer, successfully complete the trial period plan by making the required payments and return a signed loan modification agreement, we’ll sign the loan modification agreement and your mortgage will be permanently modified.</div>
<br>
<div>To prevent foreclosure proceedings, you must contact us or send your first trial period plan payment by {DateAdd({[L001]}|+14|MM/dd/yyyy|Day)}. You may contact us by phone at {[plsMatrix.CSPhoneNumber]} ext. 1495 or in writing to let us know if you accept. If you don’t contact us or send your first trial period plan payment by {DateAdd({[L001]}|14|MM/dd/yyyy)}, foreclosure proceedings may begin or continue.</div>
<br>
<div>To successfully complete the trial period plan, you must make the Trial Period Plan payments below:</div>

<div><b>We must receive each trial period plan payment in the month in which it is due.</b> If we don’t receive a trial period payment by the last day of the month in which it is due, this offer is revoked and we may refer your mortgage to foreclosure. If your mortgage has already been referred to foreclosure, foreclosure-related expenses may have been incurred, foreclosure proceedings may continue and a foreclosure sale may occur.</div>
